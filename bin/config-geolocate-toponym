# This script computes the paths of all files needed by any of the
# preprocessing or experiment-running apps in the geolocate-toponym app of
# TextGrounder, in addition to the paths computed using `config-geolocate`,
# which is assumed to have been run before this.
 
# You need to set the following environment variables on input, in addition
# to those set for or by `config-geolocate`:
#
# 1. TG_AUX_DIR: Location of auxiliary files (currently only the World
#                Gazetteer, needed only when running the `geolocate-toponym`
#                app).  This can be set directly; or if not set and
#                TG_GROUPS_DIR is set, it will be set to the subdirectory
#                `.../projects/textgrounder/data` of TG_GROUPS_DIR.
#
# 2. PCL_TRAVEL_DIR: Optional; location of PCL travel corpus and related files.
#
