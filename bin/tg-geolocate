Usage: $0 [--hadoop | --hadoop-nondist] [--app APP] [TEXTGROUNDER-OPTIONS ...] CORPUS [APP-OPTIONS ...]

Run 'textgrounder geolocate-document' (or another related app), passing it
the appropriate arguments for running on the specific corpus specified by
CORPUS.  Additional app-specific options can be given after the corpus name,
to control the operation of the application. (Try 'help' or '--help' in
place of the app options to get a help message.) Additional options to the
'textgrounder' driver script can be given before the corpus name; these
usually control operation of the JVM. (Use 'textgrounder help' to see a
description of these options.)

Currently recognized values for CORPUS:

wikipedia         Run on Wikipedia.
twitter           Run on the GeoText twitter corpus.
twitter-wiki      Run on a combination of both of the above corpora.
gutonly-small     Run on the GeoTwitterUT small corpus.

The option '--hadoop' causes the application to be run using Hadoop
(a package for large-scale parallel processing).  Before doing this,
TextGrounder needs to be built in a special way and data needs to be
copied into the Hadoop File System.  See the README.txt file for more
info.  An alternative for testing purposes is '--hadoop-nondist'.
This uses the same Hadoop-specific code in TextGrounder but runs
Hadoop in "non-distributed" mode, which simulates all of the various
file-system and compute servers on one machine and doesn't require
any special building or data copying.

The option '--app' specifies the application to run; by default it does
document-level geotagging.  Normally, the default application is
'geolocate-document'.

See also 'run-nohup', which can be used to wrap an invocation of this script
in a way that it will not be killed by session exit when run in the background,
and output will get sent to a unique, time-stamped file.
